# Welcome to R / GitHub course

In this course you will go through several lessons which will help you to practice knowledge of the statistical language R. Course is beginner friendly and goes from basics to more advanced statistical functions of R.

The whole course is set up on GitHub, each lesson is prepared in a separate branch with a simple after-push-pipeline-test. If you want to take part in this course, fork the repository with all branches and the whole environment will be set up in your GitHub space automatically. Thanks to this you will practise your R and basic Git knowledge at the same time.

Every time when you will feel like committing your work, do not forget to name your R script `script.r` (which is the only name accepted by the pipeline)
