# Lesson 1: Introduction to R and RStudio

## Introduction

Welcome to the course on "From Beginner to Master in R: A Comprehensive Data Analyst Training Course." In this lesson, we will introduce you to the R programming language and the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE). R is a powerful and popular programming language for statistical computing and graphics, widely used in data analysis, data science, and research. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface to work with R, making it easier to write, execute, and manage your R code efficiently.

## Lecture

### 1. Overview of R

Before diving into practical exercises, let's first understand what R is and what makes it so valuable in the field of data analysis. R is a free, open-source software that allows users to perform statistical computations, data visualization, and data manipulation. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

R is highly extensible and offers a vast collection of packages and libraries contributed by the R community. These packages enhance R's capabilities, enabling users to perform a wide range of data-related tasks with ease.

### 2. Installing R and RStudio

To begin your journey with R, you need to install two components: R itself and RStudio, which provides an integrated development environment for working with R. The installation process is straightforward, and you can find the required installers on the official websites: [R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### 3. Introduction to the RStudio Interface

Once you have R and RStudio installed, let's explore the RStudio interface. The interface consists of several components, including:

- **Source Editor:** This is where you write your R code in R scripts. It provides syntax highlighting, code suggestions, and error highlighting to improve your coding experience.
- **Console:** The console is where R code is executed, and the output is displayed. You can also interactively run code here to test different commands or functions.
- **Environment and History:** The environment tab shows a list of objects (e.g., variables) created during your R session. The history tab displays your previously executed R commands.
- **Files and Plots:** The files tab shows the files and directories in your working directory, making it easy to navigate and manage your project files. The plots tab displays graphical outputs.

### 4. Working with R Scripts

One of the best practices when using R is to write your code in R scripts. R scripts are plain text files that contain R code. By using R scripts, you can easily save, share, and reproduce your analyses. To create a new R script in RStudio, go to File > New File > R Script.

### 5. Using the Help Documentation

As you explore R and encounter unfamiliar functions or commands, you'll likely need help to understand their usage. R comes with extensive built-in documentation to assist you. You can access the help documentation by using the `help()` function or the `?` symbol followed by the function name. For example, `help(mean)` or `?mean` will display the documentation for the `mean()` function.

### 6. Printing Output in R

To print output in R, you can use the `print()` function or simply type the variable name in the console. For example, to print "Hello, World!" in the console, you can use either `print("Hello, World!")` or directly type `"Hello, World!"`.

## Exercise

Now that you've learned about R and RStudio, it's time to put your knowledge into practice. Follow the instructions below:

1. Install R and RStudio on your computer using the links provided.
2. Open RStudio and familiarize yourself with its interface, including the source editor, console, environment, and files and plots tabs.
3. Create a new R script and write a simple code snippet to print "Hello, World!" in the console.
4. Save the R script as "script.r" in the root folder of your GitHub repository.
5. After push, the pipeline will automatically start and compare your script with expected output

## Summary

In this lesson, we introduced you to the world of R and RStudio. You learned about the basics of R and its applications in data analysis. We also covered the installation process of R and RStudio, explored the RStudio interface, and introduced the concept of working with R scripts. Additionally, you discovered how to access R's extensive built-in documentation to find help when needed.

Remember to save your R script as "script.r" in the root folder of your GitHub repository and check if the output matches the expected result before moving on to the next lesson.
